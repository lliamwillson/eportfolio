															        <strong>10th August 2023</strong><br>
															        During this meeting, we introduced ourselves and our backgrounds, established rough timelines that we wished to respect and thus, our 
															        other commitments which we also need to respect and work in with the tasks to be completed by the team. Furthermore, we also outlined 
															        the expectations that each of us had for the process and from each other. Also, future meetings were scheduled and initial tasks of 
															        drafting a template and organising tools to be used was completed.<br><br>

															        <strong>17th August 2023</strong><br>
															        During this meeting it was established that a well-planned and structured design document template had been completed. It was reviewed 
															        and feedback from garnered and pooled then actioned. All collaborative and working tools had been used at this point and put into effect. 
															        The design document was divided up into manageable tasks and these were delegated amongst the team members. It was defined what was to be 
														                completed by the next scheduled meeting and a collaborative GitHub repository was created.<br><br>

															        <strong>24th August 2023</strong>
															        During this meeting, GitHub work on the final coding product was reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the assigned 
															        design document tasks delegated had been completed. They were reviewed and confirmed to ensure quality. Then, some of the remaining tasks for 
														                the design document were delegated and key turning point decisions were made regarding the design document.<br><br>

															        <strong>31st August 2023</strong>
															        During this meeting, submission of the design document drafted to Dr People’s for review was discussed and agreed upon, then delegated. 
															        Issues regarding our understanding of certain aspects of what was required from the design document by Dr People’s were discussed. Then, these 
															        issues were structured into tangible descriptions and prepared for review by Dr People’s. Organisation issues regarding the collaborative tools 
															        being used were then rectified.<br><br>

															        <strong>1st September 2023</strong>
															        During this meeting, Dr People’s review and comments on the design document were reviewed together and our understanding of them was discussed. 
															        Then, we delegated inputting and satisfying these comments to ensure that the design document would be completed in time for the assigned deadline. 
															        More preliminary work was reviewed which had been completed for the GitHub repository of the final code product.<br><br>

															        <strong>7th September 2023</strong>
															        During this meeting, the design document was finalised and reviewed by all team members then final decisions made were confirmed and agreed by all 
															        team members, final design document was tasks were then delegated and the team members then agreed on a final finishing date by which the design document 
															        should be completed and ready for submission. Further work on the final coding product was continued and now represented the design document and was well 
															        directed.<br><br>

															        <strong>14th September 2023</strong>
															        During this meeting, the design document was reviewed and realised as completed. Then a team member was delegated as the assigned submitter and a submission 
																date was agreed. Once these topics were discussed, the peer review document to be submitted by each individual team member were then discussed. This allowed 
																the team to provide feedback of each team member and visualise how the team had worked so far through the initial phase and prepare the team for moving 
																onto the next deadlines to meet.<br><br>

																<strong>21st September 2023</strong>
																The design document and accompanying peer review has been submitted. During this meeting, the team refocused the direction of the collaborative tools toward 
																the completion of the final coding product and the testing and review documentation to accompany it. Tasks to continue developing the final coding product were 
																delegated in line with the stipulations of the design document and the rough upcoming timeline to adhere to was defined. Furthermore, the upcoming commitments 
																of the team members were defined to ensure that delegated tasks could be completed. A document that would be used to submit the testing and review of the final 
																coding product was also created and structured.<br><br>
