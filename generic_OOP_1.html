									<strong>Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021) Article Review</strong><br>
									In the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021), I identified one aspect that I unexpected. 
									This aspect was the 3rd theme of the article; “Students found new personal strengths.”. This 
									was unexpected because my understanding of why one should develop an e-portfolio, was skewed. 
									Initially, my understanding of an e-portfolio was that it is simply an evidence of work completed 
									whilst studying. Although, whilst this is the case, it should be understood that it is also a 
									space in which the imperfections of one’s work and the learning process involved should also 
									be documented. The primary purpose of developing an e-portfolio can therefore be redefined as 
									a method to foster reflective and deeper learning.

									<p><h3>Unit 1-3 Collaborative Discussion</h3>
									<strong>Unit 1 Initial Post</strong><br>
									Padhy et al. (2018) prioritise 11 identified reusable assets associated with software development. 
									These reusable assets have been identified from analysis of relevant and appropriate articles. 
									Although, the ranking of these reusable assets is seemingly subjective.<br>
									
									<br>The following describes how I would reorder their ranking. I believe this ranking values logical 
									progression as it relates to software development. Hence, more value is unintentionally given 
									to reusable assets related to software planning and design. This is meaningful. Potentially, 
									a more objective approach.<br>
									
									<br><ol>
										<li>Requirement analysis (RA): Fundamental in any software project, is the system to be 
										utilised capable and appropriate for this development. Does technology allow 
										this development?</li>
										<li>Knowledge requirement (KR): Also fundamental, is the required development capability 
										present. Experience allows progression.</li>
										<li>Models in the project (MP): Planning the objective and purpose of software is 
										essential and perhaps the product of previous developments.</li>
										<li>Design patterns (DP): Does the design of the project allow foresight and efficient 
										development?</li>
										<li>Test cases/test design (TCTD): If testing of the software will be ambiguous, then 
										quality software cannot be the result.</li>
										<li>Architecture driven approach (ADP): If overall structure of this project is the 
										product of previous development, does this provide foresight to predict future likely 
										issues.</li>
										<li>Modules in the program (MIP): Now, the fundamentals of any in-development or built 
										project: the components of it. Discussion continued below.</li>
									</ol>
									The remaining 4 reusable assets, ‘used in the data project (UD)’, ‘an algorithm used in the 
									program (AP)’, ‘documentation in project (DIP)’ and ‘service contracts (SC)’, were identified 
									as components of an in-development or built project and therefore, seemingly trivial to rank. 
									This is because their requirement to be reusable is so obvious.<br>

									<p><strong>Unit 2 Peer Responses</strong>
									<br><strong>Reply 1</strong><br>
									Thanks for the post.<br>
									I think your approach has prioritised what is most fundamental within any software project and 
									I appreciate this. By ranking the requirement analysis (RA) and knowledge requirement (KA) as 
									1 and 2 respectively, I think this allows a very conservative and thought out approach to any 
									software project and it’s use of reusable assets. These are fundamental to beginning of any 
									project.<br>
									
									<br>Furthermore, I think this approach is continued for rankings 3 and 4, although I would argue 
									that perhaps the ranking of 3 and 4 could be switched. The architecture driven approach (ADA) 
									is seemingly broader and generally more fundamental than algorithms used in the program (AP). 
									Additionally, perhaps either test cases (TCTD) or modules in the program (MIP) are fundamental 
									at a lower level than documentation in the project (DIP).<br>
									
									<br>Finally, allocation of design patterns (DP) as worthy of ranking and the remaining reusable 
									assets as not is a focussed approach and I appreciate this. It allows an efficient summary of the 
									content of Padhy et al.’s (2018) article. Although, I would argue that the remaining reusable 
									assets not ranked do provide value to software development, it’s just simply not very meaningful 
									to provide them a rank.<br>

									Informatics. Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies. 77. Springer.

									Thanks for the post.<br>
									I think it’s important that fundamentally the Requirement analysis (RA) and Knowledge requirement 
									(KR) reusability assets are prioritised when ranking the reusability assets outlined in Padhy et 
									al. (2018). This is because they are so obviously fundamental to the beginning of any project or 
									if a project can begin at all. I appreciate that your ranking of the reusability assets reflects 
									this. I also agree that the Architecture driven approach (ADA) has assumed the position you have 
									given it.<br>
									
									<br>Furthermore, upon reading your submission I have become more aware of the importance of Service 
									contracts (SC). Your explanation of this reusable asset highlights its importance and the relationship 
									it has with being cost efficient and ensuring that the development of the project continues with 
									a focussed outcome and assurance that the end product will be a satisfactory product.<br>
									
									<br>Finally, however, I believe the Test case/Test design (TCTD) reusability asset deserves more 
									value. Ultimately, the testing process and meaningfulness of test results is significantly important. 
									This informs the end product and the value that this product will provide because assurance is provided 
									that the end product will be complete at least and more importantly achieve its objective.<br>

									<p><strong>Unit 3 Summary</strong><br>
									Upon now having experienced the learning content of the first 3 units of ‘Object Oriented Programming’ 
									and receiving feedback from my peers regarding my initial post, a discussion about Padhy et al.’s (2018) 
									article analysing and ranking the reusable assets relating to software development, this is my summary 
									review.<br>
									
									<br>The feedback provided to me primarily highlighted that my aim to more objectively rank the reusable 
									assets was ideal and that my attempt to do so by considering which assets are more low-level or fundamental 
									to the software development process is well thought out and a good approach. The feedback also generally 
									overall agreed with the ranking I provided, although some of the feedback highlighted that the assets I 
									didn’t rank potentially deserved more value. I agree with this conclusion and would revise my initial 
									submission accordingly. Although, from the content I have been exposed to in the first 3 units, I believe 
									my initial ranking, especially the first few rankings (e.g. the ranking of the Requirement analysis (RA) 
									and Knowledge requirement (KR) assets) are correct objectively. Beyond this, it becomes very difficult to 
									continue the ranking of the remaining assets because many arguably have similar value as it relates to 
									software.<br>
									
									<br>Furthermore, my initial submission did not consider aspects including time, effort, cost and efficiency 
									of software development as it relates to each individual reusable asset. By doing this I could’ve potentially 
									provided a tangible method with which each reusable asset could have been objectively valued, compared and 
									contrasted. Then, the supposed subjectivity I viewed to be present when ranking these assets would be less 
									subjective, more objective and therefore, more meaningful.<br>
									
									<br>Finally, by reviewing Padhy et al.’s (2018) article and accompanying a submission through the feedback 
									and review process, I have come to learn a lot about software development in general and more specifically 
									the aspects of software development in general and those that are reusable.<br>
