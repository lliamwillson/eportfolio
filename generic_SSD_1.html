									<strong>Collaborative Discussion #1</strong><br>
									<br><strong>Initial Post (in Unit 1)</strong><br>
									The OWASP (2023) coding weakness I have focussed on in my discussion and represented using a UML flowchart is, 
									Broken Access Control. I have utilised a use case diagram to represent Broken Access Control because this OWASP 
									weakness is defined as an instance of a malicious user story in which a user (attacker) is acting outside their 
									intended permissions and hence, mimicking administration or a higher-access level to assume their controls. Therefore, 
									because a use case diagram captures the way in which users of software interact and benefit from it, modelling Broken 
									Access Control is most appropriate using a use case diagram (Common Weakness Enumeration, 2017; OWASP, 2023).<br>

									<br>Although, modelling Broken Access Control using UML activity diagrams would also be appropriate because these 
									particular UML models show the way in which events are executed within a system over time. Because Broken Access 
									Control requires an attacker to manipulate authorised access and this involves a sequence of malicious behaviours/activities, 
									a UML activity model will successfully present in-depth detail of the process (OWASP, 2023; Rumbaugh, Jacobson & Booch, 1999).<br>

									<br>Furthermore, a UML sequence diagram has the potential to be a successful representation of Broken Access Control. 
									This is because it would represent how messages are distributed between objects and how an attacker could take advantage. 
									Although, a UML sequence diagram would be the least ideal UML model to utilise because only the messages between objects 
									involved in authenticating a user would be represented. Before this the attacker has already gained access/control and 
									is in a position to enact malicious intent (OWASP, 2023; Rumbaugh, Jacobson & Booch, 1999).<br>

									<p><strong>Peer Response #1 (in Unit 2)</strong><br>
									Thanks for your post.<br>
									<br>I agree that a UML activity diagram well represents the behaviour of users and the system in the case of illustrating an instance of 
									Broken Access Control. I also appreciate the specification that your diagram illustrates, particularly the vulnerability occurrence as it 
									relates to Broken Access Control (Rumbaugh, Jacobson & Booch, 1999).<br>
									
									<br>Although, I recommend that the ‘how’ an attacker (user) accessed the information to be able to bypass the authorisation check is included 
									in the diagram in some way. This would better illustrate the vulnerability of the system, even if the illustration is as simple as describing 
									that the authorisation requires merely input of the word ‘password’ or some other simple form of broken access. Upon analysing your illustration, 
									I have in turn realised mine own would benefit from a more specific illustration of the authorisation step.<br>

									<br>Furthermore, I agree that a UML class diagram would not be effective in showing dynamic sequence of events that lead to security vulnerability 
									as it relates to Broken Access Control. Although, I disagree with the notion that a UML use case diagram would not be effective. A use case diagram 
									presents user stories as they refer to the users of the system (inclusive of malicious user; attackers). Security vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities 
									exploited by people. Therefore, I determine the importance of UML use case diagrams as high in representation of Broken Access Control because they 
									illustrate user interactions (Rumbaugh, Jacobson & Booch, 1999).<br>

									<p><strong>Peer Response #2 (in Unit 2)</strong><br>
									Thanks for your post.<br>
									<br>I enjoyed reading your post regarding an OWASP (2023) weakness I personally have not yet illustrated a diagram for. I appreciated your inclusion 
									of the ‘Log’ behaviour in your UML activity diagram and explanation of how the absence of logging at different steps of the activity process, as it 
									relates to the system, would be a weakness that leads to compromise of the system. Although, I would argue, what is the efficiency in logging every 
									single activity of the system at every step? I suggest that perhaps logging crucial intersections which are not bypassable would be more efficient as 
									it relates to logging information and more efficient as it relates to providing auditors and monitors with usable and meaningful data (Rumbaugh, Jacobson 
									& Booch, 1999).<br>

									<br>I agree with your discussion that a UML use case diagram would be meaningful by illustrating how actors interact with the system and are prone to 
									or affected by the logging actions performed by the system. Furthermore, I believe that the activity diagram you have presented delivers a more 
									meaningful illustration versus a sequence diagram. This is because the most important focus of the diagram is the logging and the ‘noise’ in a 
									sequence diagram would deduct meaning from logging represented in the diagram. Furthermore, to this notion the current activity diagram you have 
									presented may benefit from highlighting the ‘Log’ steps (Rumbaugh, Jacobson & Booch, 1999).<br>

									<p><strong>Summary Post (in Unit 3)</strong><br>
									I am writing this upon reviewing of my peer’s responses, receiving feedback myself and creating my own initial post and accompanying UML use case 
									diagram to discuss the OWASP (2023) coding weakness, Broken Access Control. I have improvements and learnings to add to my initial submission. Upon 
									discussion with peers, I realised that a UML activity diagram is most likely and the most appropriate UML diagram to represent the OWASP Broken Access 
									Control weakness with. This is because they illustrate the dynamic nature of a system. The ‘how’ does something occur (OWASP, 2023; Rumbaugh, Jacobson 
									& Booch, 1999).<br>
									
									<br>Furthermore, this change could be reflected in mine own UML use case diagram to show more detail and focus regarding the ‘how’ an attacker would gain 
									access to ‘view payroll information’ at all. I have realised this is vitally important especially as it relates to the concept of development and then 
									how a development team would use a use case diagram to visualise the weakness and implement development solutions that prevent this weakness from being 
									taken advantage of (OWASP, 2023).<br>
									
									<br>Additionally, I have learnt that a UML sequence diagram would be effective in illustrating dynamics of the system as it relates to gaining Broken 
									Access Control. It would present more detail for complex Broken Access Control occurrences where the attacker must deploy more malicious techniques 
									versus simply knowing the password in order to authenticate themselves as administrators, for example (Rumbaugh, Jacobson & Booch, 1999).<br>
										
									<br>Importantly, however, I learnt a UML use case diagram is appropriate to use and represent the OWASP Broken Access Control weakness because my assumption 
									that it is important to illustrate user stories, was supported by my peers. In developing secure software, it is important to view the attacker’s (user’s) 
									goals and objectives from their perspective and the ‘how’ they go about gaining Broken Access Control at all. By understanding the attacker’s (user’s) needs 
									and requirements, the development team can protect against these and predict how an attacker might go about gaining Broken Access Control in the future 
									(OWASP, 2023; Rumbaugh, Jacobson & Booch, 1999).<br>

									<p><strong>Blog Post</strong>
									<br>Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security…<br>
									<br>Let’s look at why? As it relates to 5 terms from the ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 ‘Terms and Definitions’…<br>
									<br><em>3.5 authentication [provision of assurance that a claimed characteristic of an entity is correct] -</em><br>
										
									Authentication defines which people are allowed and which are not. The management of who is and is not authenticated to 
									view, edit, export or interact in any way with the information stored in a system or the system itself, is integral to 
									ensuring that cyber-attacks are prevented. This can be done through the use of an authentication system which blocks 
									unauthenticated users from access and more importantly, reports this event to the system administration for review and 
									management. Authentication is also integral to ensure for the development team and ‘inside’ people (Online Browsing Platform, 
									2018).<br>
									
									<br><em>3.9 competence [ability to apply knowledge and skills to achieve intended results] -</em><br>
									
									Competence is an issue of people. Ensuring that the people involved in development of the software are competent and 
									able in their role and importantly their understanding of security and ensuring a secure software development process 
									is also integral. Without ensuring competence of ‘inside’ people, the security of the software development process is 
									compromised and resources will eventually need to be expended to return to and fix the errors that cyber attackers (people) 
									take advantage of (Online Browsing Platform, 2018).<br>
									
									<br><em>3.12 consequence [outcome of an event (see Section 3.21) affecting objectives (see Section 3.49)] –</em><br>

									Consequence is the definitive deterrent of people. In essence, this defines why the biggest risk to cyber security is 
									people. Because without consequence, cyber-attack is certain and if it was somehow unavoidable, cyber-attack will not 
									occur. Importantly, the implementation of sufficient consequences by policy makers and development teams for cyber-attackers 
									is integral (Online Browsing Platform, 2018).<br>

									<br><em>3.24 governing body [person or group of people who are accountable for the performance (see Section 3.52) and conformity of the organization (see Section 3.50)] –</em><br>

									Governing bodies are bodies of people that manage people and consequences imposed. Therefore, they are integral to ensuring 
									cyber-attack is logged and dealt with accordingly and must be in place to ensure that governance occurs and thus, cyber-attack 
									is defined as opposite and antagonistic to governance (Online Browsing Platform, 2018).<br>

									<br><em>3.35 information system [set of applications, services, information technology assets, or other information-handling components] –</em><br>

									Information systems are built by people and exploited by people. Information systems are the mechanisms by which people store 
									information and inherently, they store sensitive information regarding people which is useful and valuable to people. Thus, 
									information systems are a target of people. Although, instead of ridding them to ensure certain security, they are necessary 
									in the modern world and ensuring security with policies and systems is integral to ensure they can continue to exist 
									(Online Browsing Platform, 2018).<br>

									<strong>What is a Secure Programming Language?</strong><br>
									<br><strong>1. What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</strong><br>
									The factors that determine whether a programming language is secure or not:<br>
									<ul>
										<li><em>Secure By Default</em> – When a programming language is secure to use out of the box with little to no configuration changes and are available 
										at no additional cost. What is easiest and most natural for a developer to use.</li>
										<li><em>Decision Density</em> – Defines how frequently a developer deals with decisions that are insecure by default and must consciously and correctly 
										make the correct decision to avoid introducing a vulnerability into the system.</li>
										<li><em>Regularity of the Language</em> – The more consistent a language is, both within a single codebase, between different codebases, between 
										different processor Instruction Set Architectures (ISA), the less prone it will be, the easier it will be for someone to learn, and the easier it 
										will be for a person or automation to review. On the opposite side, the more frequently, “what does this code do” is asked and the more frequently, 
										“well, it depends”, is answered with, the harder to learn and more prone to mistakes the language will be.</li>
										<li><em>Understandability of the Details of a Variable</em>– How easy or hard is it to look at a variable in the code, understand what it is and does, 
										what error states are possible for that variable in particular and the implications of the variable at each point?</li> 
										<li><em>Object Clarity</em> – Like above, how easy is to understand an object in a piece of code and the related object-oriented programming 
										components?</li>
										<li><em>Obviousness of Control Flow</em> – How easy is it to understand when different code executes and in what order? Specifically, complex flow 
										patterns like recursion, pre-processor generated code and function pointers make it easy to author code that is challenging to read and analyse, 
										make errors and introduce vulnerabilities.</li>
										<li><em>Visual Parsability of the Code</em> – Some languages force structure and that makes it easier to understand the code, while others have 
										opted to make decisions that challenge a human’s ability to easily understand code.</li>
										<li><em>Analysability</em> – In general how easy is analysability of code down the line.</li>
									</ul>
									(Cifuentes & Bierman, 2019; Pillai, 2017)<br>
									</p>
									
									<p><br><strong>2. Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</strong><br>
									Python can be classed as a secure language. Comparatively, it’s decision density, increasing regularity of the language, understandability of the details 
									of a variable, object clarity and in general object-oriented programming application, obviousness of control flow and analysability are very high. Although, 
									a particular characteristic relating to Python leaves something to be desired. Dependencies increase the risk of attack. Commonly, Python repositories contain 
									more than just the code. They contain open-source packages, container images and configuration files used to provide infrastructure. The growing volume of 
									dependencies expands the attack surface of projects. And, on average Python projects have ~35 dependencies.<br>
									
									<br>Despite this weakness, Python is more secure than C. In C comparatively, neither compile-time nor run-time checks prevent a variable of one type being changed 
									to or interpreted as another type. In Python, there are guarantees on the kinds of data that a given variable might hold, the allowed set of values, their 
									representation or the operators that may be carried out on the data.<br>

									<br>Python is also a secure language because of how the following factors relate to it:<br>
									<ul>
										<li>Syntax</li>
										<li>Stacks</li>
										<li>Regex</li>
										<li>Recursion</li>
										<li>Queues</li>
										<li>Polymorphism</li>
										<li>Pointers</li>
										<li>Mutability</li>
										<li>Inheritance</li>
										<li>Grammar</li>
										<li>Memory Management</li>
										<li>Encapsulation</li>
										<li>Casting</li>
										<li>Abstraction</li>
									</ul>
									(Cifuentes & Bierman, 2019; Pillai, 2017)<br>
									</p>

									<p><br><strong>3. Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</strong><br>
									Whilst theoretically, Python would provide a more secure foundation on which to build an operating system, there are trade-offs for this security. 
									These include, operating system performance and an inability to create more base-level applications.<br>
									
									<br>In Python there are almost no compilers that can generate machine code at a low level. This is required because when creating an operating system, 
									you need to generate machine code for the specific hardware that you want to use with the operating system you are designing. Furthermore, 
									at this lowest level of creating an operating system C is processor specific while Python is not.<br>

									The following are the features of a well-secured system:
									<ul>
										<li><em>Least Privilege</em> – Ensure all users and services have the least privileges required to carry out their task.</li>
										<li><em>Open Design</em> – That is do not try to make a system secure by hiding its internals or operations.</li>
										<li><em>Fail-Safe Defaults</em> – Assume that credentials are incorrect and make the operation fail-safe until data has been validated.</li>
										<li><em>Separation of Privilege</em> – That is segregate users (and processes) into tiers based on levels of trust and ensure any access between tiers 
										is checked and validated.</li>
										<li><em>The Least Common Mechanism</em> – That is ensure that mechanisms used to access resources are not shared.</li>

									<br><strong>Part I: Buffer Overflow in C</strong><br>
									<strong>What happens?</strong><br>

									When ‘./bufoverflow’ is run in Terminal and a name of less than or equal to 8 characters is inputted, the system outputs the name repeated back to the User. 
									When a name of more than 8 characters is inputted, the system outputs:<br><br>
									
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>> *** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated<br>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>> Aborted (core dumped)<br>

									<br>...the program fails. See appendix.<br>

									<br><strong>What does the output message mean?</strong><br>
									The output message means that the input does not fit into the specified buffer size of ‘8’ and is therefore, rejected and the system aborts the program or 
									more specifically, the core. This is protective. It prevents deliberate buffer overflow which determines a system unavailable. See appendix.<br>

									<h1>start of oop content [DO NOT CONTINUE] [EVERYTHING AFTER TO BE DELETED]</h1>	
									In the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021), I identified one aspect that I unexpected. 
									This aspect was the 3rd theme of the article; “Students found new personal strengths.”. This 
									was unexpected because my understanding of why one should develop an e-portfolio, was skewed. 
									Initially, my understanding of an e-portfolio was that it is simply an evidence of work completed 
									whilst studying. Although, whilst this is the case, it should be understood that it is also a 
									space in which the imperfections of one’s work and the learning process involved should also 
									be documented. The primary purpose of developing an e-portfolio can therefore be redefined as 
									a method to foster reflective and deeper learning.

									<p><strong>Unit 1 Initial Post</strong><br>
									Padhy et al. (2018) prioritise 11 identified reusable assets associated with software development. 
									These reusable assets have been identified from analysis of relevant and appropriate articles. 
									Although, the ranking of these reusable assets is seemingly subjective.<br>
									
									<br>The following describes how I would reorder their ranking. I believe this ranking values logical 
									progression as it relates to software development. Hence, more value is unintentionally given 
									to reusable assets related to software planning and design. This is meaningful. Potentially, 
									a more objective approach.<br>
									
									<br><ol>
										<li>Requirement analysis (RA): Fundamental in any software project, is the system to be 
										utilised capable and appropriate for this development. Does technology allow 
										this development?</li>
										<li>Knowledge requirement (KR): Also fundamental, is the required development capability 
										present. Experience allows progression.</li>
										<li>Models in the project (MP): Planning the objective and purpose of software is 
										essential and perhaps the product of previous developments.</li>
										<li>Design patterns (DP): Does the design of the project allow foresight and efficient 
										development?</li>
										<li>Test cases/test design (TCTD): If testing of the software will be ambiguous, then 
										quality software cannot be the result.</li>
										<li>Architecture driven approach (ADP): If overall structure of this project is the 
										product of previous development, does this provide foresight to predict future likely 
										issues.</li>
										<li>Modules in the program (MIP): Now, the fundamentals of any in-development or built 
										project: the components of it. Discussion continued below.</li>
									</ol>
									The remaining 4 reusable assets, ‘used in the data project (UD)’, ‘an algorithm used in the 
									program (AP)’, ‘documentation in project (DIP)’ and ‘service contracts (SC)’, were identified 
									as components of an in-development or built project and therefore, seemingly trivial to rank. 
									This is because their requirement to be reusable is so obvious.<br>

									<p><strong>Unit 2 Peer Responses</strong>
									<p><br><strong>Reply 1</strong><br>
									Thanks for the post.<br>
									I think your approach has prioritised what is most fundamental within any software project and 
									I appreciate this. By ranking the requirement analysis (RA) and knowledge requirement (KA) as 
									1 and 2 respectively, I think this allows a very conservative and thought out approach to any 
									software project and it’s use of reusable assets. These are fundamental to beginning of any 
									project.<br>
									
									<br>Furthermore, I think this approach is continued for rankings 3 and 4, although I would argue 
									that perhaps the ranking of 3 and 4 could be switched. The architecture driven approach (ADA) 
									is seemingly broader and generally more fundamental than algorithms used in the program (AP). 
									Additionally, perhaps either test cases (TCTD) or modules in the program (MIP) are fundamental 
									at a lower level than documentation in the project (DIP).<br>
									
									<br>Finally, allocation of design patterns (DP) as worthy of ranking and the remaining reusable 
									assets as not is a focussed approach and I appreciate this. It allows an efficient summary of the 
									content of Padhy et al.’s (2018) article. Although, I would argue that the remaining reusable 
									assets not ranked do provide value to software development, it’s just simply not very meaningful 
									to provide them a rank.<br>

									Thanks for the post.<br>
									I think it’s important that fundamentally the Requirement analysis (RA) and Knowledge requirement 
									(KR) reusability assets are prioritised when ranking the reusability assets outlined in Padhy et 
									al. (2018). This is because they are so obviously fundamental to the beginning of any project or 
									if a project can begin at all. I appreciate that your ranking of the reusability assets reflects 
									this. I also agree that the Architecture driven approach (ADA) has assumed the position you have 
									given it.<br>
									
									<br>Furthermore, upon reading your submission I have become more aware of the importance of Service 
									contracts (SC). Your explanation of this reusable asset highlights its importance and the relationship 
									it has with being cost efficient and ensuring that the development of the project continues with 
									a focussed outcome and assurance that the end product will be a satisfactory product.<br>
									
									<br>Finally, however, I believe the Test case/Test design (TCTD) reusability asset deserves more 
									value. Ultimately, the testing process and meaningfulness of test results is significantly important. 
									This informs the end product and the value that this product will provide because assurance is provided 
									that the end product will be complete at least and more importantly achieve its objective.<br>

									<p><strong>Unit 3 Summary</strong><br>
									Upon now having experienced the learning content of the first 3 units of ‘Object Oriented Programming’ 
									and receiving feedback from my peers regarding my initial post, a discussion about Padhy et al.’s (2018) 
									article analysing and ranking the reusable assets relating to software development, this is my summary 
									review.<br>
									
									<br>The feedback provided to me primarily highlighted that my aim to more objectively rank the reusable 
									assets was ideal and that my attempt to do so by considering which assets are more low-level or fundamental 
									to the software development process is well thought out and a good approach. The feedback also generally 
									overall agreed with the ranking I provided, although some of the feedback highlighted that the assets I 
									didn’t rank potentially deserved more value. I agree with this conclusion and would revise my initial 
									submission accordingly. Although, from the content I have been exposed to in the first 3 units, I believe 
									my initial ranking, especially the first few rankings (e.g. the ranking of the Requirement analysis (RA) 
									and Knowledge requirement (KR) assets) are correct objectively. Beyond this, it becomes very difficult to 
									continue the ranking of the remaining assets because many arguably have similar value as it relates to 
									software.<br>
									
									<br>Furthermore, my initial submission did not consider aspects including time, effort, cost and efficiency 
									of software development as it relates to each individual reusable asset. By doing this I could’ve potentially 
									provided a tangible method with which each reusable asset could have been objectively valued, compared and 
									contrasted. Then, the supposed subjectivity I viewed to be present when ranking these assets would be less 
									subjective, more objective and therefore, more meaningful.<br>
									
									<br>Finally, by reviewing Padhy et al.’s (2018) article and accompanying a submission through the feedback 
									and review process, I have come to learn a lot about software development in general and more specifically 
									the aspects of software development in general and those that are reusable.<br>

									<p><h3>Unit 3 Activities</h3>								
									<strong>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) & UML Models</strong><br>
									The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) involves 6 stages. They are,<br>
									
									<ol>
										<li>Planning</li>
										<li>Defining</li>
										<li>Designing</li>
										<li>Building</li>
										<li>Testing</li>
										<li>Deployment</li>
									</ol>
									Furthermore, there are 3 general UML model types. These are, 
									
									<ol>
										<li>Behavioural = Capture the interactions between system components over time</li>
										<li>Structural = Represent components of a system and relationships between them</li>
										<li>Architectural = Capture high-level perspective of system</li>
									</ol>
					
									The various UML diagram types fit 1 of the 3 above UML types. A few diagram types have been 
									described below where they are most applicable in the SDLC.<br>
				
									<br>Use Case Diagrams – Define system functional requirements. Therefore, most ideal in the planning, 
									defining and designing stages of the SDLC. This is because by being able to visualise the 
									functional requirements of a system before it’s built allows developers to visualise a complete 
									broad overview of the system and its interactions.<br>
					
									<br>Component diagrams – Shows the system components. Similar reasoning as above.<br>
				
									<br>Object diagrams – Represents instances of system classes. Therefore, because this type of 
									diagram analyses specific points in time, it is most ideal to use deep in the planning and 
									building stages of the SDLC.<br>
									
									<br>Timing diagrams – Show change of state or value of elements over time. Therefore, most ideal 
									to use during the testing stage of the SDLC to identify the ‘flow’ of various values and 
									elements within a program.<br>
						
									<br>State Machine diagrams – Capture transitions of a system between activities and states executed. 
									Thus, ideal to utilise in the designing stage primarily because this diagram involves 
									defining actions that determine the state/activity of the following component in the diagram.<br>
					
									<br>Architectural diagrams (generally) – Provide overall framework capture and therefore, ideally 
									best use is throughout the initial stages.<br>

									<p><strong>The Metrics Used To Assess The Features Of An Object Oriented Program</strong><br>
									Object Oriented Program (OOP) metrics are used to determine the success or failure of a program, 
									provide general evaluation and are a method used to quantify the improvements in software needed. 
									Simply described, OOP metrics are used to characterise software engineering products, processes 
									and people. Specifically, these metrics are software/program (i) efficiency, (ii) complexity, 
									(iii) understandability, (iv) reusability, (v) testability/maintainability. These metrics 
									are self-explainable in terms of their importance as they relate to the quality of a 
									program/software.<br>

									<br>These metrics are affected by the techniques used when coding programs/software. An example is 
									inheritance. Inheritance helps us to introduce reusability, efficiency and to control complexity 
									of a program. Furthermore, encapsulation enhances software quality by ensuring safety via information 
									hiding. Objects have public interfaces to allow communication with them and understandability. 
									However, that same object can hold private information and methods that can be changed without 
									global affect.<br>

									<p><strong>Data Structures & How They Support Object-Oriented Programming</strong><br>
									Data structures organise data. Inherently, organisation of data supports efficiency and capability of 
									object-oriented programs in relation to how they can then access this data and with what ease and clarity. 
									This makes sense because objects themselves are a type of data structure and thus, compatible with use 
									of other data structures. Different data structures are more suitable for different applications and 
									therefore, the most appropriate one must be utilised to maximise program efficiency. Resultant is the most 
									ideally defined relationship between multiple pieces of data and therefore, objects in object-oriented programs. 
									3 types of data structures are, dictionaries, lists and tuples.<br>

									<br>Dictionaries (also referred to as a map, hash map, lookup table or associative array) are a data structure 
									type that allow a random number of objects to be stored, with a unique dictionary key allowing identification 
									of each. Lists are ordered collections of items and referred to via indexing. Finally, tuples are immutable 
									and the data in one tuple is related to and of relevance to data in other tuples.<br>
									
									<br>Benefits that data structuring provides to object-oriented programs are, faster detection of anomalies, 
									improved data quality and availability of data, greater transparency within data teams, better regulatory 
									compliance and faster data analysing.<br>

									<p><strong>Unit 8 Initial Post</strong><br>
									The Internet of Things (IoT) describes real world objects that participate in the internet and therefore, 
									must be globally networked, discovered and exploited. Smart Objects (SOs) which are physical objects that 
									are actual implementations of IoT, are strengthened by improvements in processing, communication, sensing 
									and actuation functionality. To fully exploit an SO’s potential, Fortino et al. (2015) suggest modelling of 
									the system’s properties must occur at different levels of abstraction. They attempt utilising metamodels. 
									Different versions of metamodeling map SO basic features and high-level interactions.<br>
									
									<br>Of course, metamodeling has strengths and weaknesses and these directly relate to the successful implementation 
									of improved SO functionality. These will be discussed. Primarily, the strength of a metamodel lies in its 
									reduction of the computational burden associated with computationally demanding analyses of simulation models. 
									Thus, they are comparatively quick to develop, simple to derive, extremely flexible and more cost efficient. 
									Furthermore, they are well suited to deterministic applications such as SOs. And finally, are useful in ‘linearizing’ 
									otherwise highly complex conceptualisations.<br>
									
									<br>Weaknesses of metamodeling as they relate to SOs must be considered. Firstly, depending on the complexity of 
									the SO conceptualisation or application, ‘linearization’ can be difficult to extract; specialist expertise 
									may be required depending. Furthermore, the adequacy of the model is determined solely by individual conclusions. 
									And finally, at this time there exists little suitable software for expediting and making efficient the modelling 
									process.<br>

									<p><strong>Reply 1</strong><br>
									Thank you for the post.<br>
									I agree completely and think it is highly insightful to regard the fact that metamodeling can provide a ‘standardised’ 
									approach to the development of software as a strength. Without a standard or at least expectation regarding what the planning 
									phase should produce, the goals of the modelling stage of software development can become very convoluted and not directed 
									and focussed towards a goal and clear outcome. Furthermore, and as mentioned, prioritisation of time efficiency in this aspect 
									of the development process is highly valuable as lack of time is something that plagues all development projects.<br>
									
									<br>Finally, I agree that metamodeling techniques for IoT will become likely outdated as technology advances and the complexity of 
									their planning requirements advance with them. Although, I view this as a great opportunity to continue to ensure that the standard 
									processes of metamodeling are refined and themselves advanced in a way that remains clear for those who use them. In effect, when 
									the metamodeling techniques must be advanced, so must they be reviewed and perfected.<br>

									Thank you for the post.<br>
									I agree. The main advantage of metamodels for IoT is their ability to provide modelling for abstract to detailed system designs. 
									Therefore, metamodeling techniques are accommodating for both simple and complex applications. Highly versatile. I continue to agree 
									with your discussion that in effect with versatility and a wide variety of usage options, metamodeling has many configurations and 
									custom uses. Therefore, standardisation remains difficult to define even though standardisation provides many benefits including 
									prioritisation of time efficiency and therefore, overall benefit to the development project.<br>

									<p><strong>Set Operation Descriptions</strong><br>
									The ‘union’ set operation returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all 
									items from the specified set/s. Application of this operation type in a program for an autonomous 
									car could include, when there is a need to collate all data retrieved by the system and then perform 
									analysis on this data.<br>

									<br>The ‘intersection’ returns a set that contains the similarity between two or more sets. Application of 
									this operation type in a program for an autonomous car could include, when there is a need to isolate 
									data and exclude non-relevant data in whatever functionality might need to be executed.<br>

									<br>The ‘difference’ returns a set that contains the difference between two sets. Application of this operation 
									type in a program for an autonomous car could include, when an identifier as it relates to the system and 
									when the data point was collected in relation to corresponding data points needs to be determined. This 
									could be to determine some conclusion about perhaps the surrounding environment of the autonomous car.<br>

									<br>The ‘symmetric difference’ returns a set that contains all items from both sets, but not the items that are 
									present in both sets. Application of this operation type in a program for an autonomous car could include, 
									when there is a need to identify a repeated data entry by the system and therefore, perhaps as it relates 
									to an error.

									<p><h3>Unit 9 Activities</h3>
									<p><strong>Cyclomatic Complexity & Object Oriented Programming</strong><br>
									Cyclomatic complexity is very relevant to object oriented systems and code because it aims to
									quantitatively measure the complexity and therefore, quality of code. It encourages succinct 
									and concisely built systems that are as efficient as possible. Supposedly, ‘size’ of code is 
									proportional to effort and complexity of code. A greater number lines of code is associated with 
									a greater productivity requirement, decreased quality and higher development cost.<br>

									<br>It is advantageous to analyse cyclomatic complexity because it can guide the testing process, it’s 
									easy to apply, it’s used to measure minimum effort. Although there are weaknesses associated. Cyclomatic 
									complexity is a measure of control complexity and not data complexity and by promoting nested structures 
									and the most succinct versions of code, there is a higher understanding and skill-level requirement. 
									Finally, in case of simple comparisons, they may give a misleading figure and overall, cyclomatic 
									complexity is language dependent.<br>

									<br>An alternative metric to consider is the ABC metric. It is designed to measure software size and attempts 
									to overcome the disadvantages of cyclomatic complexity. It is a more broad and therefore, theoretically 
									accurate view of complexity because too many variables and factors exist that can skew a specific 
									metric like cyclomatic complexity.<br>

									Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, vol. 7, no. 2, pp. 67-82.

									<p><strong>Article Review Regarding Comments in Code (Python Specific)</strong><br>
									Rani et al.’s (2021) article determined that the comments I implement to Python code are low-level details 
									regarding public methods, instance variables, and subclasses, in addition to a high-level summary of the 
									class. The article also describes that in Python, class comments are written as docstrings (& processed by 
									sing specialised tools) containing similar annotations to denote various information types. These attributes 
									associated with writing comments for Python code are so because Python is dynamically-typed and supports 
									object-oriented, functional and procedural programming.<br>

									<p><strong>A Note About Design Patterns & Compatibility</strong><br>
									Only some design patterns are compatible with others. Generally, creational, structural and 
									behavioural design patterns are compatible with respectively, creational, structural and 
									behavioural (their own) design patterns. But, furthermore it is likely that design patterns 
									dealing with objects and classes and any given language, etc. are compatible with one another 
									also. Like is compatible with like.
									</p>
	
									<p><strong>Zhang & Budgen (2012): Design Patterns</strong><br>
									Zhang & Budgen’s (2012) article outlines which design patterns are used most commonly and why. 
									The most used design patterns are the singleton, factory, observer, builder and adapter design 
									patterns.<br>
									
									<br>A singleton design pattern is used to limit the creation of a class to only one object. This 
									pattern is used commonly because it allows you to have a single instance of a class that won’t need 
									to change much. Next, a factory design pattern is used because it allows creation of all sorts of new 
									classes, which allows creation of classes tightly coupled to the concrete implementation of your code. 
									An observer design pattern allows many objects to observer a single object. This allows implementation 
									of dependency between objects. Also, the builder design pattern is useful often because it is utilised 
									to build objects, but this can be complex. Finally, the adapter pattern allows incompatible classes to 
									work together. It does this by converting the interface of one class into another.<br>
